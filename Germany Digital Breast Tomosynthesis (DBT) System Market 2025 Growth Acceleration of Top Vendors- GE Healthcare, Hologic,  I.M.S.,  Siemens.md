<strong>Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) System Market Snapshot 2025-2033 provides a concise overview of market trends, forecasts, and growth opportunities over the forecast period:</strong>

Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is a 3D breast imaging technique built on full field digital mammography technology. DBT systems create multiple projection images of the breasts obtained from different angles of the rotating X-Ray tube at a low radiation dose through the compressed breast. Images are reconstructed into multiple slices of 1mm thickness and viewed on a dedicated monitor approved for tomosynthesis. This minimizes the impact of tissue superimposition resulting in better visualization of the internal structures. Conventionally, breast screening was performed step by step, starting with full-field digital mammography (FFDM or 2D mammography) followed by digital breast tomosynthesis (3D mammography) or breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). FFDM is considered the gold standard in breast cancer screening. However, with the advent of DBT technology, it is slowly being replaced. DBT is frequently used as an adjunct technique with FFDM. Research and studies are being undertaken to consider DBT as a primary screening tool, particularly in patients with dense breasts. 3D mammography has proven to be better than 2D mammography in multiple clinical trials, which has led to an increase in its adoption. Combination of 2D and 3D mammography has become The Global <a href=https://www.reportsinsights.com/sample/587731>Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) System Market 2025 report</a> delivers a thorough analysis of the current state of the global Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) System market, emphasizing the significant trends, dynamics, and competitive landscape shaping the industry.
