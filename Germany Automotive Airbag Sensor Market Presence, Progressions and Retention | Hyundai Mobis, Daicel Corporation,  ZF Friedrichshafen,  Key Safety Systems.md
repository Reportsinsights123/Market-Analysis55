<strong>According to a recently published analytical study titled ""Global Automotive Airbag Sensor Market Industry Analysis, Comprehensive Forecast, and Opportunities Assessment (2025–2033),"" the report provides an in-depth evaluation of market trends, growth opportunities, and projections.</strong>

Airbag sensors are responsible for detecting sudden deceleration in a collision. It sends a signal to the airbag control unit which use the vehicle speed, yaw, seat belt and ECU to determine if an airbag should deploy in a crash. Sensors are used for detecting and responding to electrical or optical signals. A sensor converts physical elements (such as temperature, blood pressure, humidity, and speed) into an electrical form, which is easy to measure. They measure physical properties of the environment such as temperature, weight, size, and luminance.  Sensors are classified based on the elements they detect and measure. They are basically divided into two types namely: Active sensors and passive sensors. Other common types of sensors are mechanical, electrical, radiation, magnetic, and chemical.
